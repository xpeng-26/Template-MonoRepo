### Tools

1. `pyenv` to manage the Python virson.
2. `uv` to manage the dependencies. ![UV Project](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/). ![UV Features](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/features/#scripts)
3. `git`
4. `pre-commit` and `ruff`
5. `pytest`

### Creating a new project (subrepos)

```bash
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world

git init
pyenv local 3.12
uv init

uv add pre-commit
uv add ruff
uv add pytest
```

### Managing dependencies

```bash
# activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate
# add a new package
uv add requests
# remove a installed package
uv remove requests
# upgrade a installed package
uv lock --upgrade-package requests
```

### Development

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv run example.py
# when calling uv run, it will automaticly lock and sync the environment, which is equvilent to
# uv lock
# uv sync

git add .
# ‚ú® This command will trigger the pre-commit hooks, automatically running ruff and commitlint
git commit -m "feat: add amazing new feature"
git push origin main
```
